## Design

### Design Choices
Website design was designed to look professional, clean and modern looking

### Colour
For the colors on the web page, I used dark grays and browns that matched the background image very well and created a nice and cohesive look while still being accessible and providing enough contrast between the foreground and background elements. I also chose the golden color to give the site an expensive look and focus attention

### Fonts
For website I chose Noto Serif Lao and Tiro Devanagari Hindi fonts

### Structure
The page is structured in a user-friendly and easy-to-learn way. Upon arriving at the website the user sees the home page, where the purpose of the site is explained. The website consists of 10 separate pages:
1. Home page
2. Post details page
3. Booking page
4. Edit booking page
5. Login page
6. Logout page
7. Signup page

The website is designed to have a natural flow, with a strong focus on the booking functionality. Most pages include booking buttons or calls to book an appointment. The home page specifically features a booking button right on top, so a user doesn't have to scroll at all to make an appointment. This is especially handy and necessary for recurring customers, who will be the gross of the clientele.

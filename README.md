## Design

### Design Choices
Website design was designed to look professional, clean and modern looking

### Colour
For the colors on the web page, I used dark grays and browns that matched the background image very well and created a nice and cohesive look while still being accessible and providing enough contrast between the foreground and background elements. I also chose the golden color to give the site an expensive look and focus attention

<br>
<details><summary>Colour Pallete</summary>
<img src="static/img/colour-pallete.png">
</details>
<br>

### Fonts
For website I chose Noto Serif Lao and Tiro Devanagari Hindi fonts

### Structure
The page is structured in a user-friendly and easy-to-learn way. Upon arriving at the website the user sees the home page, where the purpose of the site is explained. The website consists of 13 separate pages:
1. Home page 
2. About us page
3. Blog page
4. Post details page
5. Booking page
6. Edit booking page
7. Contact page
8. Login page
9. Logout page
10. Signup page
11. 403 page
12. 404 page
13. 500 page

The website is designed to have a natural flow, with a strong focus on the booking functionality, blog section and contact page. Most pages include booking buttons or calls to book an appointment. The home page specifically features a booking button right on top, so a user doesn't have to scroll at all to make an appointment. This is especially handy and necessary for recurring customers, who will be the gross of the clientele. 

### Logic and Database Diagram

The logic of the app was thought out by making a database diagram, to visualize which objects will need to be created for this app to be functional and how they will be connected to each other. Notably, the initial database diagram was incomplete, which was discovered during production of the app. See the images below:

<details><summary>Database diagram:</summary>
<img src="static/img/database diagram.png">
</details>
<br>
- Built with Python and the Django framework with a database of a Postgres for the deployed Heroku version(production).

## Features

The app's biggest feature is of course the booking page and consequently, the user booking page. These two pages are all you need, to book an appointment, cancel the booked appointment or change its date. This is where we will start our journey:


#### ***Book page***

This page is where most users, especially the recurring ones, will spent the grunt of their time. When you first open the page, you will be welcomed by a simple form with datepicker. You are urged to select a service first

<details><summary>Book page</summary>
<img src="static/features/features_book.png">
</details>
<br>

The datepicker will become fully visible and usable and users can select a date. When you select a date, the available times in the time picker will be rendered and user can scroll through the available times. After user picks a time, the time gets entered automatically in the date field of the booking form. The other fields in the form are either auto-filled when user is logged in, or filled in by user upon booking.

<details><summary>Book page selected time/date</summary>
<img src="static/features/features_book_datepicker.png">
</details>
<br>

After hitting the book button, user will get confirmation of their booking and are urged to go to their booking dashboard.

<details><summary>Book Confirmation</summary>
<img src="static/features/features_book_confirmation.png">
</details>
<br>

#### ***Booking dashboard***
When the user goes to their booking dashboard, they are greeted a section with all their booked appointments. Which they can expand like an 'accordion' by clicking on the element.

<details><summary>Booking dashboard </summary>
<img src="static/features/features_booking_dashboard.png">
</details>
<br>

When an appointment lays further in the future, user can can delete the appointment by clicking on the delete button.
When delete gets clicked, user will be asked to confirm their choice, by a modal that pops up. This is to make sure the user really meant to click the delete button, since cancelling an appointment by mistake would be very inconvenient.

<details><summary>Booking dashboard delete </summary>
<img src="static/features/features_booking_delete.png">
<img src="static/features/features_booking_delete_confirmation.png">
</details>
<br>

The other button present in the appointment accordions is a 'Change date' button. This button will allow the user to change the date or time of the appointment. After clicking the button, they will be redirected to a page similar to the booking page, except the service is pre-selected. 

<details><summary>Booking dashboard edit</summary>
<img src="static/features/features_booking_edit.png">
<img src="static/features/fetures_booking_edit_confirmation.png">
</details>
<br>

#### ***Blog***

The user can find the blog section. The blog is accompanied by a photo selected for the topic of the post, the date of its addition and the number of likes are written. every post is clickable. based on the topic of the post, the user can click on the title and go to the page with this post.

<details><summary>Blog </summary>
<img src="static/features/features_blog.png">
</details>
<br>

#### ***Post details***
After selecting a post, the user can go to a separate post details page that shows the title, post, likes, and comments. The user can also comment on each post if he registers

<details><summary>Post details </summary>
<img src="static/features/features_post_details.png">
<img src="static/features/features_comment.png">
</details>
<br>

<details><summary>Comment confirmation </summary>
<img src="static/features/features_comment_confirmation.png">
</details>
<br>

#### ***Contact***

The contact page displays a simple form for the user to fill out in order to send a message to the owner.

<details><summary>Contact page </summary>
<img src="static/features/features_contact.png">
</details>
<br>

#### ***Home***

Let's get on with the rest of the website. The home page features a few elements.

#### ***Nav bar***

At the top of the page you'll find a nav bar with booking buttons. The nav bar will display either a login button, or when user is logged in, their name. When user clicks their name, a menu will pop out with the options to log out or go to their booking dashboard.

#### ***Admin***

Site owner has a lot of control over the website and database entries via the admin panel. The admin can look at registered email-adresses, appointments, contact messages, posts, comments and likes.

## Security Features and Defensive Design

### User authentication

* Django's all auth was used for login and sign up functionality.
* Django's superuser is used to limit access to admin panel.

### Form Validation

Extensive form validation is used on front end as well as backend.

### Database Security

All secret keys connecting the database are stored in a env.py file that is never pushed to github. Furthermore, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSFR) tokens were used on all forms throughout the project.

##### Back to [top](#table-of-content)<hr>

## Deployment

### Local Deployment

To test the app locally, the terminal within VScode was used. The steps to run this:

* In your project workspace folder, open a terminal
* Run the command: ```python3 manage.py runserver```
* Hit the 'open browser' button or visit ```http://localhost:8000/``` in the browser.
* Use the website as usual.

A local database was used for most of the local deployment usage, since it was necessary for the automated tests to run. However, the switch to using the production database could be easily made, in case migrations needed to be performed or otherwise. Furthermore, in the development version, DEBUG was set to False, so error messages would show follow.

### Production Deployment Initial

Before starting work, the project was deployed to Heroku. This was done early in the process, to prevent having to deal with difficulties of deployment close to the project deadline. The following steps needed to be performed:

#### Create Heroku app:

* Login in to Heroku
* Create a new app.
* Select "New" and "Create new app".
* Give the new app a name and click "Create new app".
* Select a region (Europe for this app).

#### Connect Postgres Database:

* Open your app on the main dashboard of Heroku.
* Open the Resources tab and scroll to the add-ons section.
* Type 'Postgres' and select the Heroku Postgres option.
* Copy the DATABASE_URL in the Config Vars section of the Settings tab.
* To use the Postgres database in your development environment, copy the DATABASE_URL in your env.py file.

#### Deploy App on Heroku:

* Click "Settings".
* Navigate to the "Config Vars" section and click "Reveal Config Vars"
* Add SECRET_KEY variable
* Add CLOUDINARY_URL variable
* Add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY variables.
* Under "Deployment Method" click on "GitHub" to get access to your repository.
* Enable Automatic Deploys" or click "Deploy Branch" to deploy your app.

### Production Deployment Update

Since Heroku stopped offering free tiers on the 28th of november 2022, it was necessary to make a few adjustments to the whole production deployment of the app. 

#### PostgreSQL database:

The Postgres database add-on that was previously used within Heroku was now no longer free and thus a different service had to be used. The choice went to [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/), since they offer a free tier. A [script](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/postgres-migration-tool) written by Code Institutes team was used to copy the original database to the new database. The steps are described in the [github readme](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/postgres-migration-tool) of that script.

After that, the steps were as follows:

* remove database add on from Heroku.
* remove old DATABASE_URL config var from settings and post new url from ElephantSQL database in its place.
* transform app from free tier to an eco dyno.

### Making a Local Clone
